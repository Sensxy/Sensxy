# Hi there! <img src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/11711-kirby_vibing/download" width="30"/>
I’m Ozan, a full-stack developer and aspiring SWE based in the United States.

I'm passionate about building systems that deliver tangible impact, with a strong focus on applying AI and machine learning to create scalable, intelligent solutions for real-world problems

Outside of code, you’ll find me gaming, traveling, watching anime/reading manga, or hitting the gym. I also do content creation on the side and have over 16M+ views combined!

### Fun Facts:
- I absolutely HATE cheese but generally will eat almost anything else
- My favorite music artist is King Krule
- I have a manga panel sleeve of tattoos

Let’s connect!
