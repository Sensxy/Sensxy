# Hi there! <img src="https://slackmojis.com/emojis/11711-kirby_vibing/download" width="30"/>
I’m Ozan, a full-stack developer and aspiring product builder based in the United States.

I love bringing ideas to life—from backend APIs to intuitive user experiences—and I’m especially interested in using AI to solve everyday problems.

Outside of code, you’ll find me gaming, traveling, watching anime/reading manga, or hitting the gym. I also do content creation on the side and have over 16M+ views combined!

### Fun Facts:
- I absolutely HATE cheese but generally will eat almost anything else
- My favorite music artist is King Krule
- I have a manga panel sleeve of tattoos

Let’s connect!
